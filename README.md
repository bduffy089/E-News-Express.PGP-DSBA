E-News Express Project for PGP-DSBA

## Problem Definition
An online news portal aims to expand its business by acquiring new subscribers. Every visitor to the website takes certain actions based on their interest. The company plans to analyze these interests and wants to determine whether a new feature will be effective or not. Companies often analyze users' responses to two variants of a product to decide which of the two variants is more effective. This experimental technique is known as a/b testing that is used to determine whether a new feature attracts users based on a chosen metric.

Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in E-news Express. The design team of the company has created a new landing page. You have been assigned the task to decide whether the new landing page is more effective to gather new subscribers. Suppose you randomly selected 100 users and divided them equally into two groups. The old landing page is served to the first group (control group) and the new landing page is served to the second group (treatment group). Various data about the customers in both groups are collected in 'abtest.csv'. Perform the statistical analysis to answer the following questions using the collected data.

## Objective:
Statistical analysis of business data. Explore the dataset and extract insights from the data. The idea is for you to get comfortable with doing statistical analysis in Python.

You are expected to perform the statistical analysis to answer the following questions:

Explore the dataset and extract insights using Exploratory Data Analysis.
Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than the old landing page?
Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?
Does the converted status depend on the preferred language? [Hint: Create a contingency table using the pandas.crosstab() function]
Is the mean time spent on the new page same for the different language users?

*Consider a significance level of 0.05 for all tests.
